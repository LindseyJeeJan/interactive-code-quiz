# interactive-code-quiz
Description: This single page application provides a fun learning experience for the user. User must select from multiple option questions and has 70 seconds to complete the quiz. Answering a question incorrectly will cause the user to lose 10 additional seconds from the clock. If time runs out, the user will receive their score at that point. High scores are kept in local storate and displayed. The user may enter initials into a form to be posted on the high score list. This application uses JavaScript.
